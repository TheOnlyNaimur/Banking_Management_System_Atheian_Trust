Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each function:

1. getVaultBalance

Purpose: This is a custom function defined to get the balance of a specific vault account from the database.

How it Works:
It takes a database connection ($conn) and a vault master account number ($vault_master_account) as parameters.
It executes a SQL query to select the balance from the vault table where the bank_master_account matches the provided account number.
It returns the balance if the query is successful, or 0 if the account is not found or an error occurs.




2. mysqli_query

Purpose: Executes a SQL query against the database.

How it Works:
It takes two arguments: a database connection ($conn) and a SQL query string ($sql).
It returns a result set resource if the query is successful, or FALSE if there is an error.





3.mysqli_num_rows

Purpose: Returns the number of rows in a result set.

How it Works:
It takes a result set resource (from a mysqli_query call) as its parameter.
It returns the number of rows in the result set. If there are no rows, it returns 0




4.mysqli_fetch_assoc

Purpose: Fetches a result row as an associative array.

How it Works:
It takes a result set resource (from a mysqli_query call) as its parameter.
It returns an associative array where the keys are the column names from the result set and the values are the corresponding data.
It returns NULL if there are no more rows in the result set.

In a typical scenario, you might use these functions like this:

mysqli_query is used to execute a query to fetch data from the database.
mysqli_num_rows checks if there are any rows returned by the query.
mysqli_fetch_assoc retrieves each row of data as an associative array to process or display the data.
getVaultBalance is a custom function that uses mysqli_query, mysqli_num_rows, and mysqli_fetch_assoc to retrieve and return the balance of a vault account.
